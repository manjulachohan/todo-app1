# TODO APP CONSTITUTION

## Core Principles

This document establishes the fundamental principles and rules governing the development of the Todo App under Hackathon II rules (Panaversity).

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: All code must be generated strictly from approved specifications
2. **No Manual Coding**: No code shall be written outside of spec-driven generation
3. **No Vibe Coding**: No ad-hoc or intuitive coding without proper specification
4. **History Preservation**: All specification iterations must be permanently preserved
5. **Immutable Specs**: Old specifications must never be deleted or overwritten

## Development Methodology

- All features must be specified before implementation
- Specifications must evolve through documented iterations
- Each iteration must be timestamped and versioned
- Final specifications must be explicitly marked as "APPROVED"

## Project Scope

The Todo App shall be an in-memory Python CLI application with the following core features:
- Add Task
- View Tasks
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- Mark Task as Complete

## Quality Standards

- All specifications must be clear, unambiguous, and implementable
- Specifications must include expected behavior, inputs, outputs, and edge cases
- Implementation must strictly adhere to approved specifications
- History must provide complete traceability from initial concept to final implementation

## Compliance Verification

This constitution shall be referenced throughout development to ensure adherence to Hackathon II rules. Any deviation from these principles invalidates the project's compliance status.
